# Princess Escape
This game was created during the annual "Game Maker's Toolkit Gamejam" (or short GMTK Gamejam). The Theme in 2023 was "Roles Reversed".
We had 48h for developing our submission. Every commit to this project after July 9th was created after the submission deadline and therefore was not part of 
our submission for the GMTK Gamejam.
